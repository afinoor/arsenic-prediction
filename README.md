# Using Machine Learning to Aid Initiatives to Reduce Arsenic Poisoning
Between 20 and 45 million people in Bangladesh are exposed to arsenic contamination in drinking water, exceeding both national and WHO limits. The Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project (BAMWSP) reported arsenic presence in 61 out of 64 districts' tube wells in 2019-2020.

Van Geen's research in Araihazar, Bangladesh, demonstrated that simply testing well water and educating residents about arsenic's dangers could persuade 60% of them to switch to safer water sources. This method costs under $1 per person, making it financially viable for developing countries compared to drilling private medium-depth wells, which cost $28 per person.

Despite the low-cost and effectiveness, 40% of the population still continued using polluted wells. Most households in the Araihazar region are within 100 meters of a safe well, suggesting that awareness alone might not be enough for everyone.

This project aims to build a predictive model using demographic and behavioral data to identify those unlikely to switch to safer wells even after awareness campaigns. Four machine learning models will be evaluated to determine the best one for predicting this behavior, optimizing the approach to reduce arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh effectively.
